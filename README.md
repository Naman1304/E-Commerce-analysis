In this project, we aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis of our E-commerce platform to gain insights that will contribute to business optimization and growth. The analysis will cover various aspects of our online business, from customer behavior and purchasing patterns to website performance and marketing effectiveness.



### Project Components

1. Power BI Dashboard: Developed to visualize and analyze the credit card data.
2. Entityâ€“relationship model (ER Diagram): Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for an E-commerce system involves identifying key entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.
3. CSV Data File: Contains raw E-commerce transaction data.
4. Logo: logo for a project involves designing a visual representation that encapsulates the essence, purpose, and identity of the project. 
5. README.md File: Provides an overview of the project, its purpose, components, and how to use it.



### Steps to Reproduce

1. Database Creation:
    Create a SQL Server database.
    Import the provided CSV file into the database.
2. Data Cleaning and Transformation:
    Connect Power BI to the SQL Server database.
    Import the E-commerce data tables into Power BI.
    Perform data cleaning, including removing unnecessary columns, handling null values, and adjusting data formats.
3. Dashboard Creation:
    Design and create visualizations to represent E-commerce analysis findings.
    Include relevant charts, graphs, and tables to showcase spending patterns, trends, and insights.
